# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

This analysis aims to create a line graph that shows the total fares by each city type; Urban, Suburban, and Rural. We created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average per ride, and average per driver and the multiple line plot.

## Results:

Due to the availability of drivers, PyBer rides in rural areas; the data shows that the total number of rides and the average fares per driver affect one another. As the cities get farther from urbanized areas, the fares ride and driver will increase.

## Summary:

Since the total fares for different cities seem to increase and decrease at the end of February in all areas, the company should investigate what causes this increase and decrease. Having fewer drivers can increase the average fare per ride and driver. PyBer can use this information to determine how many drivers it should have in order to achieve its profit goal.
